This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```


```{r}
# Let's make sure we start fresh
closeAllConnections() # Close all file connections (like PDFs, PNGs, CSVs)
rm(list = ls()) # Clear variables
cat("\014") # Clear console
```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
# Libraries ---------------------------------------------------------------
setwd('/home/marie/rRepos/joeProject/')
library(raster)
```

```{r}
# Import data -------------------------------------------------------------
gpp <- raster('gpp_2020-2021.tif') # full extent of polygons given
plot(gpp)
watersheds <- shapefile('WatershedsComp.shp')
plot(watersheds) # looks good
```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
